    "6. Monitoring and Logging: Monitoring and logging mechanisms should be incorporated into the infrastructure design to track the performance, resource utilization, and potential issues in the system. This helps in identifying bottlenecks, optimizing resource allocation, and troubleshooting problems.\n",
